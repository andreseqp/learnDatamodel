Summary data used for statistical analyses of the empirical part of the biological market analysis. Here, the data from fish censuses and behavioural observations were averaged per site/year for statistical purposes. This helped in attributing similar values to individuals from the same reef site (please refer to the manuscript for more details).



Column heading	Description


site			the study reef sites (Corner Beach, Mermaid Cove, Horseshoe, 				Northern Horseshoe, The Crest)

year			year of the data collection


site_year               Sites at Lizard Island and year when data were collected 

ID                      Identity of cleaner wrasse during the data collection



market_both_score       number of trials needed to solve the initial and the reversal of 			the biological market task 


market_binomial             binomial response in the biological market task. "Yes" 					cleaners solving both the initial and reversal test, while 				"No" is for cleaners failed to solve initial and reversal 				in the biological market task.


abundance_clients_100m2 estimated client species abundance in 100 m2 from the transect 				data

abundance_large_100m2   estimated large species abundance in 100 m2 from the transect data

abundance_small_100m2   estimated small species abundance in 100 m2 from the transect data

abundance_cleaner_100m2      estimated number of cleaner fish, Labroides dimidiatus, in 				100 m2 from the transect data

cleaner_large_ratio       the ratio of 1 cleaner to 100 LARGE clients estimated from count 				of cleaners divided by count of large clients and 					multiplied by 100


cleaner_small_ratio       the ratio of 1 cleaner to 100 SMALL clients estimated from count 				of cleaners divided by count of small clients and 					multiplied by 100



cleaner_client_ratio       the ratio of 1 cleaner to 100 clients estimated from count of 				cleaners divided by count of clients and multiplied by 100



opportunities_total     number of visitors seeking a cleaning service simultaneously with 			another client (s) or/and with a client already interacting with 			the cleaner wrasse

swim_off                number of visitors from the “all.opportunities” events (see 				description above) swimming off when not receiving a cleaning 				service

percentage_swim_off     percentage of visitors swimming off when not serviced by the 				cleaner calculated from number of visitors swimming off (swim_off) 			from the total number of all opportunities (opportunities_total)
